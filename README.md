#EBR-Boilerplate

This boilerplate is meant to be used in lightweight web-apps. It is however possible to extend the 

Being a fan of [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/), [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/), [Require.js](http://requirejs.org/) and [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)), I made this boilerplate to use in my future projects.

### Express.js setting in this boilerplate

In this Express.js setup, I'm using Jade and Stylus. If you want to use something else instead, remember to change the configurations in coffee/app.coffee

##How to use?

The first thing to do is to download the boilerplate. In the terminal, use this command:

    git clone git://github.com/johnsj/ERB-Boilerplate.git

Next, you install the dependencies:

    npm install

Now you should be ready to create some awesome web-apps :)

### Using CoffeeScript (Optional)

The intention was NOT to edit the `.js` files. Only edit the `.coffee` files inside the root coffee folder. However, not every library/framework is available in CoffeeScript. That's why I made is possible to use good old javascript, without any hassle.

In order to keep things simple, I suggest that you open a terminal, and type:

    /path/to/erb-boilerplate/coffee -o ./ -cbw coffee/

Notice that I'm using the -b flag. If you want the top-level function safety-wrapper,
just remove the 'b'.

By running this command, all of the coffee-files will be compiled and output to the root folder, maintaining the structure.

## NOTE

This is very much a work in progress. It would be helpful, if you try this out, and send me an email with your opinions :)
